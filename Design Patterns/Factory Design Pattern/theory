What Factory method pattern does?
It allows us to create objects by specifying their common interface at run time without imposing their
concrete class creation logic.

When to use the Factory method pattern?
1.There should be a set of classes which implement a common interface
2.You don’t know which object to create ( You know which object to create only at run time)
3.Object initialization is somewhat expensive(Have to do some operations in order to create an object)

Factory method act as an actual factory. It creates our products which we request
but we don’t need to aware of how they are created.
